  abstract  = {Serverless architecture encompasses many things, and before jumping into creating serverless applications,
it is important to understand exactly what serverless computing is, how it works, and the benefits and use
cases for serverless computing. Generally, when people think of serverless computing, they tend to think of
applications with back-ends that run on third-party services, also described as code running on ephemeral
containers. In my experience, many businesses and people who are new to serverless computing will
consider serverless applications to be simply “in the cloud.” While most serverless applications are hosted
in the cloud, it’s a misperception that these applications are entirely serverless. The applications still run
on servers that are simply managed by another party. Two of the most popular examples of this are AWS
Lambda and Azure functions. We will explore these later with hands-on examples and will also look into
Google’s Cloud functions.},

  abstract = {New architectural patterns (e.g. microservices), the massive adoption of Linux containers (e.g. Docker containers), and improvements in key features of Cloud computing such as auto-scaling, have helped developers to decouple complex and monolithic systems into smaller stateless services. In turn, Cloud providers have introduced serverless computing, where applications can be defined as a workflow of event-triggered functions. However, serverless services, such as AWS Lambda, impose serious restrictions for these applications (e.g. using a predefined set of programming languages or difficulting the installation and deployment of external libraries). This paper addresses such issues by introducing a framework and a methodology to create Serverless Container-aware ARchitectures (SCAR). The SCAR framework can be used to create highly-parallel event-driven serverless applications that run on customized runtime environments defined as Docker images on top of AWS Lambda. This paper describes the architecture of SCAR together with the cache-based optimizations applied to minimize cost, exemplified on a massive image processing use case. The results show that, by means of SCAR, AWS Lambda becomes a convenient platform for High Throughput Computing, specially for highly-parallel bursty workloads of short stateless jobs.},

  abstract = {In the late-1950s, leasing time on an IBM 704 cost hundreds of dollars per minute. Today, cloud computing, that is, using IT as a service, on-demand and pay-per-use, is a widely used computing paradigm that offers large economies of scale. Born from a need to make platform as a service (PaaS) more accessible, fine-grained, and affordable, serverless computing has garnered interest from both industry and academia. This article aims to give an understanding of these early days of serverless computing: what it is, where it comes from, what is the current status of serverless technology, and what are its main obstacles and opportunities.
